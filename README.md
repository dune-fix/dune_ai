## Overview

DUNE AI is an advanced analytics system for Solana meme coins, inspired by the concepts from Frank Herbert's Dune series. Like the Fremen scouts who monitor the desert, DUNE AI scans the vast landscape of Solana tokens to identify emerging trends, potential opportunities, and risks.

The system consists of three main components:

### 🔍 X(Twitter) Sentinel

Real-time analysis of Twitter trends to detect new Solana meme coins and market sentiment. Like the Fremen scouts of Dune, it monitors the "desert" of social media for important movements.

- Monitors Twitter for mentions of Solana tokens
- Tracks sentiment and identifies emerging trends
- Detects new token launches from social signals

### 📊 Spice Trend Engine

Analyzes cryptocurrency community sentiment and market trends to predict future movements. Like the spice melange of Dune that grants future vision, this engine helps anticipate market shifts.

- Analyzes trends across multiple data sources
- Identifies correlations between tokens
- Generates predictive models for price movements

### 🪱 Sandworm Scanner

Automatic detection and analysis of new Solana coin launches, with a focus on identifying potential high-growth opportunities. Like the massive sandworms that can detect movement across the desert, this scanner monitors the blockchain for new token activity.

- Monitors Solana blockchain for new token launches
- Analyzes token metrics and creator wallets
- Calculates risk scores and potential growth factors

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously scans Twitter and Solana blockchain for new tokens and trends
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced NLP to gauge market sentiment for specific tokens
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies chart patterns and correlations between tokens
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates risk scores based on multiple factors
- **Trend Prediction**: Uses historical data to predict future price movements
- **Wallet Analysis**: Examines creator wallets for insights into token legitimacy
- **Token Clustering**: Groups similar tokens based on price movements and characteristics

## Token Detection Strategy

DUNE AI uses multiple signals to identify potential high-growth meme coins:

1. **Social Signals**: Monitoring Twitter for emerging trends and sentiment
2. **On-chain Activity**: Analyzing token transactions, holder distribution, and liquidity
3. **Creator Analysis**: Examining the history and patterns of token creators
4. **Market Behavior**: Identifying unusual price or volume movements
5. **Pattern Matching**: Comparing to known successful meme coin patterns
